.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ar lsmac
is an ls-like utility for listing the files contained in a given directory on a HFS or HFS+ volume and the MacOS
meta-data associated with them.  The output is akin to that of the ls long view.  Each line follows the format below:
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It [Finder flags] [file type] [creator type] [size] [name or path]
.El
.Pp
The Finder flags of each file are displayed as a sequence of six characters.  Each character indicates whether one
of the following flags are set:
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It I
File has the Invisible flag set
.It C
File has the Custom Icon flag set
.It L
File is Name Locked (i.e. it is a system file)
.It B
File has the Bundle bit flag set
.It A
File has the Alias flag set
.It S
File has the Stationery flag set
.El
.Pp
A '-' indicates that a flag is not set.  For example, a file with none of the Finder flags set would be listed as '------' while
a file with all the flags set would be listed as 'ICLBAS'.
