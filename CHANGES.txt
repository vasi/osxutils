Version 1.8 by Dave Vasilevsky

I have updated it to work on 64-bit systems and modern versions of Mac OS X.

- Wrote Makefile, since xcodeproj files are fragile
- Replaced or rewrote deprecated functions
- Rewrote 'trash' so it properly renames files
- Getting OS 9 comments is not possible on OS X 10.5 and later
- wsupdate is probably useless on modern systems

Tested on Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. I'd appreciate if anybody wants to test on other versions as well.
