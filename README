osxutils is a bundle of Mac OS X command line utilities that bring power over all sorts of Mac-specific information, settings and meta-data to the command line.

Active development here has ceased. There's a newer, supported fork [here](https://github.com/specious/osxutils) which you may prefer to use.

osxutils is written by Sveinbjorn Thordarson. I have updated it to work on 64-bit systems and modern versions of Mac OS X. Change notes:

- Wrote Makefile, since xcodeproj files are fragile
- Replaced or rewrote deprecated functions
- Rewrote 'trash' so it properly renames files
- Getting OS 9 comments is not possible on OS X 10.5 and later
- wsupdate is probably useless on modern systems

Tested on Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. I'd appreciate if anybody wants to test on other versions as well.
